The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can 
be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML 
describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
